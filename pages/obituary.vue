          Jan had 9 brothers and sisters, and grew up in various Western states, traveling with her family on many road trips during the summer. These early road trips sparked a love of road trip adventures throughout her life. As a young woman, Jan attended Santa Ana Community College where she got her Associate degree in Library Science. After graduating, she was a research librarian at a teaching hospital in Orange County, Calif., researching new documented medical procedures found in published medical journals around the world, for the medical residents at the hospital. She was a mix of Google and WebMD, before the internet existed. On March 21, 1970, she married Jack Lee Davidson in the Los Angeles LDS Temple. Early in their marriage they took a cross country road trip, solidifying another road trip family. Together they had three children. Later, she returned to her love of libraries, when she set up and worked at several schools and public libraries in Monterey County, Calif. She was a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where she served in her favorite calling as an ordinance worker at three different temples in two states. She also loved serving in the Primary and Young Womenâ€™s organizations. She was a quilter, seamstress, family genealogist, gardener and librarian.
