After graduating, she was a research librarian at a teaching hospital in Orange County, Calif., researching new documented medical procedures found in published medical journals around the world, for the medical residents at the hospital. She was a mix of Google and WebMD, before the internet existed. On March 21, 1970, she married Jack Lee Davidson in the Los Angeles LDS Temple. Early in their marriage they took a cross country road trip, solidifying another road trip family. Together they had three children. Later, she returned to her love of libraries, when she set up and worked at several schools and public libraries in Monterey County, Calif. She was a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where she served in her favorite calling as an ordinance worker at three different temples in two states.
